# Cyberbullying-Detector

**Problem**

Presence of cyberbullying and mental health issues in our schools

• Correlation between cyberbullying and social media

• Technology offers us effective tools to identify and counter such instances

• Making parents aware of their children’s experiences

**Target audience **

• People who feel they are subject to cyberbullying

• People who use social media or some form of it (especially children)

• Parents of the two above groups

**Solution**

• Scraped data from social media platforms, cleaned dataset, to train LSTM Model to build AI detector.

• Sentimental analysis

• LSTM RNN model

**Future Scope**
